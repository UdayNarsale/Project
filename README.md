# Generic Data Structure Library
The Technical project that I have done is Customized Generic Data Structure Library. I have done this project using c++. This project has extensive use of datatypes like pointers and structures. In this project I have written functions which implements the data structures like Linked list and all its variants, stack, queue, tree. All these data structures are already there in the STL(Standard Template Library) provided by c++ language. I have implemented my own STL which will give the same functionalities. Purpose of doing this project is to learn how the data structures internally created, work and how the different actions are performed on them.
The basic building-block of implementing these data structures is creating a user-defined structure which has two elements i.e. a data(generic->int,char,float,etc) and a pointer(two pointer in case of doubly linked list). The data holds the information which has to be stored and pointer(next) which has the address of the next node. The pointer to the node is created in the driver function which points to the first node. Then the different functions for inserting new nodes can be called. There are different functions like InsertFirst, InsertLast, InsertAtPos. Similarly there are functions to delete node and count the number of nodes.
